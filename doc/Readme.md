# Readme for `doc` in `yasim`

This contains configurations of a GPMF-style documentation builder for `yasim`. If you wish to build your own copy of documentation, do as follows:

```shell
bash setup_gpmf.sh
. activate_gpmf.sh
make doc
```

And a documentation in PDF and HTML will be built under `doc/_build`.

PDF documentations requires LaTeX to be installed. Other requirements including `sphinx` is self-managed and no preparation is required.
