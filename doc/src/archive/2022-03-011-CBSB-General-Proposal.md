2022-03-11, Zhejian YU, Yaqi SU, Ruihong YUAN

## Introduction

This project is designed to write a simulator that generates artificial novel alternative splicing (AS) events and real gene expression patterns in universal organisms for the purpose of profiling tools that is claimed to be able to detect AS events and expression levels.

## What is Done and What is Left

The Infrastructure Construction like GTF Parser, FASTA/FASTQ Parser, Gene-Transcript-Exon Three-Tier Abstraction ahd almost done.

What is left is mainly the CBSB [^CBSB] part, that is, to fit distributions.

[^CBSB]: Computational Biology \& Systems Biology is a course at University of Edinburgh.
