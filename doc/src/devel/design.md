# Design of YASIM

## Steps of Simulation

- Input: reference transcriptome (Human or _C. Elegans_, given by a GTF file).
- Simulate AS events based on a statistical model given by mining raw data and literatures.
- Output AS events as ground truth GTF, and transcribe GTF into ground truth cDNA.
- Use Low-Level Read-Generators (LLRGs) like [pbsim2](https://github.com/yukiteruono/pbsim2) or [dwgsim](https://github.com/nh13/dwgsim) to generate raw reads forNext- or Third-Generation Sequencing.
- Align to reference genome using a spliced aligner and call alternative splicing events using software like [Stringtie](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie) or [Freedie](http://github.com/vpc-ccg/freddie).
- Compare the results with ground truth with [gffcompare](https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare).

## Definitions and Terminologies

Here lists definitions and terminologies used in API docs, etc.

Low-Level Read Generators (LLRG)
: A program that simulates the behaviour of real sequencers. It can be abstracted to a step, which takes input sequence, sequencing depth and some error profiles, and generates simulated sequencing data with its satistical parameters (e.g., read length, truncation, GC bias, etc.) like data generated by real sequencers.

LLRG Python Adapter
: A Python class that wraps LLRG, or LLRG Shell Adapter, to integrate it into main simulation process. It is called by LLRG UI (introduced below).

LLRG Shell Adapter
: A Shell script that handles installation and maintainance of LLRGs.

LLRG User Interface (LLRG UI)
: A Command Line Interface (CLI) provided by YASIM that allows user to produce simulated reads using their preferred LLRGs.
