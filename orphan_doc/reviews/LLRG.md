- Article:
  - Review
    - SimLoRD is more convenient than PBSIM and FASTQSim for parameters setting to simulate PacBio CCS reads
    - pbsim:
      - First, the quality value (QV, also called the Phred quality score) at each position for a simulated read is randomly chosen, but we found that the proportions of different QVs in real PacBio reads are different. 
      - Second, we also observed that the error rate of simulated reads is higher than QV.
    - FASTQSim:
      - Takes long time in simulating
      - Not flexibly to directly change parameters.
      - Error rate of simulated sequences produced not well matched to the QV.
  - Method:
    - Steps:
      - modeling read length distribution
      - selecting QVs
      - calculating overall base error probability
      - assigning different base error probabilities.
    - Read length:
      - log-normal distribution
      - sequencing depth
      - sampling fron known PacBio FASTA/FASTQ
    - QVs:
      - from the pre-trained QVs table
      - from user-defined table
    - Error probabilities:
      - QV of each base in read sequence is logarithmically related to the base error probability

- Highlights:
  - pass
- Article 1:
  - A model-and-simulate approach.
  - Steps:
    - Modelling:
      - Use reference FASTA and Aligned MAF as input.
    - Simulation:
      - lengths of errors are drawn from the statistical models, and the error types are determined by a Markov chain
  - Read Length:
    - For aligned reads, typically only a middle region can be aligned, leaving the flanking head and tail regions soft-clipped from alignments.
      - The length distribution of these head and tail regions exhibits a multimodal pattern.
      - The full read length distribution can be characterized by two empirical distributions: one for the length of the aligned regions, the second for the ratio of alignment lengths to read lengths.
    - Length distributions of unaligned reads are also generated to simulate unaligned reads.
  - Sequencing Errors:
    - Stretches of substitution errors as being distributed according to Poisson distribution.
    - Indels follow Weibull distributions.
    - All error modes have a second component of geometric distribution, which we postulate describes stochastic noise.
    - substitution errors are not uniform, with a weak bias toward G and C
    - The k-mer bias of ONT reads
      - As a DNA molecule with a stretch of homopolymer sequence traverses through a nanopore, the change in electric current is not detectable or fails to be interpreted by the base-calling algorithm, leading to a deficient representation of homopolymers longer than the number of bases that can fit in the nanopores
- Article 2:
  - Review
    - DeepSimulator: cannot provide the ground truth at the base level.
  - Highlights:
    - output the correct number of simulated reads for each transcript
    - Markov chain model to calculate the transitional probabilities between the states of spliced and retained introns
    - Users may also provide their own expression profile to simulate Transcript abundance.

  - Scopus Cited 34, ?
- Highlights:
  - Instead of being a simulator that only mimics the result, our simulator mimics Nanopore sequencing deeply by simulating the entire processing pipeline.
  - When translating the sequences into the current signals, we build a context-dependent pore model using deep learning methods
- Article 1:
  - Review
    - SiLiCO, NanoSim, ReadSim:
      - same property of generating simulated data utilizing the input nucleotide sequence and the explicit profiles (a set of parameters, such as insertion and deletion rates, substitution rates, read lengths, error rates and quality scores)
      - Not truly capture the complex nature of the Nanopore sequencing procedure, which contains multiple stages including sample preparation, current signal collection and basecalling
  - Steps:
    - To run the simulator, the user just need to input a reference genome or assembled contigs, specifying the coverage or the number of reads.
    - The sequence would first go through a preprocessing stage, which produces several shorter sequences, satisfying the input coverage requirement and the read length distribution of real Nanopore reads.
    - Then, those sequences would pass through the signal generation module, which contains the pore model component and the signal repeating component.
      - The pore model component is used to model the expected current signal of a given k-mer (k usually equals to 5 or 6 and here we use 5-mer without loss of generality).
      - Followed by the signal repeating component to produce the simulated current signals in a mixture alpha distribution.
      - Add Gaussian noise with the user-defined variance parameter to each position of the simulated signals.
    - Finally, the simulated signal would go through [Albacore](https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/albacore-offline-basecalli/v/abec_2003_v1_revad_29nov2016/linux), the ONT official basecaller, to produce the final simulated reads.
  - Pore Model:
    - Currently, all the [existing pore models](https://github.com/nanoporetech/kmer_models) are context-independent, which assign each 5-mer a fixed value for the expected current signal regardless of its location on the nucleotide sequence.
    - We propose a novel context-dependent pore model, taking advantage of deep learning techniques.
  - Read Length: Not easy to distinguish, 3 distributions observed:
    - Exponential distribution to fit it (e.g. reads from the human genome).
    - Beta distribution to fit it (e.g. reads from the E. coli genome).
    - Mixture distribution with two gamma distributions to fit it (e.g. reads from the lambda phage genome).
- Article 2:
  - Review:
    - For example, though the final simulated reads have almost the same error distribution as the real reads, for some sequences, the divergence between the simulated raw signals and the real signals can be large, which can be inconvenient for the users who care about the signal outputs.
    - In addition, the Nanopore technology has evolved greatly since DS1.0 was released.
  - Updates:
    - As for the sequence generator, we updated the sample read length distribution to reflect the newest real reads’ features
    - In terms of the signal generator, we added one more pore model, the context-independent pore model, which is much faster than the previous context-dependent one.
    - We added a low-pass filter to post-process the pore model signals.
    - We added the support for the newest official basecaller, Guppy, which can support both GPU and CPU.

  - Scopus Cited 2
- Highlights:
  - fulfill the as yet unmet need for simulation software capable of generating raw nanopore signals with realistic and controllable noise characteristics.
- Article:
  - Review:
    - Most currently available programs can only simulate nanopore reads on the already abstracted base-space level after base calling, but cannot be used to simulate raw nanopore signals as generated by the ADC
    - ReadSim and SiLiCo: statically model the read characteristics, and no parameters may be adopted from a real-world nanopore sequencing run.
    - NanoSim: feature a training phase where characteristics may be taken from real-world experimentally generated fasta sequence files.
    - DeepSimulator: Despite outputting raw data, this software only generates idealized signal values without any noise characteristics from a given reference genome.
  - Method seems like Deepsim with more params.

  - Scopus Cited 7
- Highlights:
  - pass
- Article:
  - Background: PacBio sequencing has been developed quickly with multiple versions
  - Review:
    - PBSIM: can simulate reads using either a model-based or sampling-based method. But the read length distribution of PBSIM does not match current data well.
    - LongISLND:
      - considers multi-pass sequencing of PacBio platform.
      - employs a sequence context sensitive method called extended-kmer to deal with the homopolymer-dependent bias and it can output in multiple file formats.
      - cannot process the file format of Sequel data.
    - NPBSS can use the relationship between the real error rate and quality values (QVs) while it takes a long time in simulating
    - For the sequences from the latest sequencer Sequel, a fixed quality value (QV) was used so the QVs do not represent the actual error rates whereas the methods of PBSIM and NPBSS simulating sequencing errors are based on QVs.
    - These three simulators built their sequencing error models based only on the aligned regions from alignment results, thus some information about the sequencing error, especially those regions with low qualities, were missing.
  - Real Dataset
    - longer template will be cycled less.
    - The head and tail regions of some reads may not be aligned back to the reference sequences because of the high error rates on these regions.
    - Every event (Match, Insertion, Deletion, Mismatch) is recorded with its corresponding 3-base sequence in reference and the continuous error is regarded as one event.
      - inserted nucleotides depend on the sequence context.
  - Simulation:
    - the number of forward-reverse cycles is estimated from the distribution of pass-number and the read length is determined by the corresponding length distribution of this pass-number.
    - randomly samples one error-free read from a user-specified reference genomic sequence.
      - If the selected sequence contains Ns, those Ns are replaced randomly with ACGTs in the read.
    - The collected read is treated as a sequence template, and the subreads of it alternate between the forward and reverse strands.
    - Finally, errors are introduced to get the output read.
      - The reads that are marked to come from the same template are divided into presumed unaligned part and aligned part according to the relative position inside the polymerase read. 
      - For the presumed unaligned sections, we use a preset high error rate. According to the comparison between different preset error rates we chose 0.4 as the default value.
      - As for the aligned regions, an event type is randomly drawn based on the context-specific bin recorded in the model.

  - Scopus Cited ?
- Highlights:
  - Simulation of the non-uniformity of errors: a hidden Markov Model with a latest model selection method called factorized information criteria
- Article:
  - Real Sequence Reads:
    - the true error information of real data is not easy to obtain
    - PacBio sequencers have lesser systematic (or context-specific) errors (e.g. errors in high- and low-GC regions and at homopolymer runs)
    - PacBio reads have regional bias of error distribution within the reads, and very low-quality regions are sometimes observed 
      - Low-quality regions are caused by chimeras and undetected adapter sequences, as well as non-uniformity of errors
  - Review:
    - NanoSim: generates a set of read profiles from alignment-based analysis, and simulates low-quality regions using the profiles
    - PaSS: adopts preset high error rates for both ends of the reads, to simulate low-quality regions
    - Badread: can introduce chimeras, adapter sequences, low-quality regions and low-complex repetitive sequences into simulated reads
  - Steps:
    - Determine read length according to the read length distribution
      - gamma distribution for read length, although log-normal distribution was employed in the previous version of PBSIM.
      - [DAZZ_DB/simulator](https://github.com/thegenemyers/DAZZ_DB/blob/master/simulator.c), SimLoRD, and NPBSS employ log-normal distribution for PacBio
      - SiLiCO employs log-normal distribution for PacBio, as well as gamma distribution for Nanopore
      - DeepSimulator1.5 employs beta, exponential and mixed gamma distribution for Nanopore
      - Badread employs gamma distribution for both PacBio and Nanopore.
    - Determine read accuracy according to the read accuracy distribution
      - PacBio and Nanopore sequencers utilize exponential distributions for read accuracy, although normal distribution has been employed in the previous version of PBSIM.
      - Badread employs beta distribution for both PacBio and Nanopore
    - Generate quality scores of each position in the read using the generative model, which was trained for each read accuracy of each chemistry.
    - Sample a random position from the reference sequence and cut out a nucleotide sequence of the read length.
    - Introduce errors (substitution, insertion and deletion) into the nucleotide sequence according to a quality score at each position of the read and the ratio of error types
      - For each position of the read, all error types (substitution, insertion and deletion) are introduced according to quality score at that position.
      - In the previous version of PBSIM, deletion rate is uniform throughout all positions of every simulated read, but the latest datasets show that the rates of all error types are related to the quality score
      - With regard to a deletion, there is no quality score for the deletion itself; thus, the quality score of the 5’neighbor is used.
  - Sampling-based simulation implemented in PBSIM can also be used in PBSIM2.
  - Also built profile for other simulators.
  - PacBio reads had small 6-mer bias, whereas Nanopore reads had significant 6-mer bias
